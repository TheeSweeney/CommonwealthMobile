                    <p>The United States spends far more on health care than other high-income countries, with spending levels that rose continuously over the past three decades (Exhibit 1). Yet the U.S. has poorer health outcomes, including life expectancy, than other countries.1 Mortality rates, after improving for several decades, worsened in recent years, aggravated by the opioid crisis.2 In addition, as the baby boom population ages, more people in the U.S.—and all over the world—are living with age-related disabilities and chronic disease, placing pressure on health care systems to respond.</p>

                    <p>Timely and accessible health care could mitigate many of these challenges, but the U.S. health care system falls short, failing to deliver indicated services reliably to all who could benefit.3,4 In particular, poor access to primary care, along with wasteful overuse of drugs and technologies, have contributed to inadequate prevention and management of chronic diseases, delayed diagnoses, incomplete adherence to treatments, and coordination and safety problems.</p>

                    <p>Recently, several new federal initiatives—notably the Affordable Care Act—have promoted actions to improve U.S. health care system performance. The ACA promised to extend insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans and to spur innovation in health care delivery by changing payment incentives for providers. As a 2017 Commonwealth Fund report showed, the ACA has catalyzed widespread and historic gains in access to care across the U.S. 5 But whether these initiatives have been enough to close the performance gap between U.S. and other countries remains an open question.</p>

                    <p>This report compares the health care system in the U.S. with those in 10 other high-income countries. We based our analysis on 72 measures that fall within five performance domains important to policymakers, providers, patients, and the public: Care Process, Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and Health Care Outcomes (see box).</p>

                    <p>Our data come from a variety of sources. One is comparative survey research. Since 1998, The Commonwealth Fund, in collaboration with international partners, has supported surveys of patients and primary care physicians in advanced countries, collecting information for a highly standardized set of metrics on health system performance. Other comparative data are drawn from the most recent reports of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, and the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

                        <h5>Care Process</h5>
                        <p>Care Process encompasses four subdomains relevant to health care for the general population: preventive care, safe care, coordinated care, and engagement and patient preferences. </p>

                        <p>The preventive care measures include four survey items related to counseling by health professionals on healthy behaviors and measures of mammography screening and influenza vaccination. Effective management of chronic conditions can reduce the incidence of avoidable hospital admissions. As such, this domain also includes age- and sex-standardized rates of avoidable hospital admissions for diabetes, asthma, and congestive heart failure. </p>

                        <p>Safe care is represented by three measures. The subdomain addresses patient reports about medical mistakes including effective management of medications and diagnostic and laboratory test result reporting. It also addresses the use of electronic clinical decision supports in primary care that can improve safety. </p>

                        <p>Coordinated care uses seven measures to summarize timely sharing of information between primary care clinicians, specialists, emergency departments and hospitals. It also addresses communication between primary care clinicians and home care and social service providers.</p>

                        <p>Engagement and patient preferences represents 10 measures that evaluate the degree to which doctors and other health professionals deliver patient-centered care, which includes effective and respectful clinician–patient communication and care planning that reflects the patient’s goals and preferences.</p>
                        

                        <h5>Access</h5>

                        <p>Access encompasses two subdomains: affordability and timeliness. The six measures of affordability include patient reports of avoiding medical care or dental care because of cost; or having high out-of-pocket expenses, facing insurance shortfalls, or having problems paying medical bills. One measure reflects primary care doctors’ views of the difficulty patients face in paying for care.</p>

                        <p>Timeliness includes nine measures (three of which are reported by primary care clinicians) summarizing how quickly patients can obtain information, make appointments, and obtain urgent care after hours. It also addresses the length of time needed to obtain for specialty and elective care.</p>

                        <h5>Administrative Efficiency</h5>

                        <p>Administrative Efficiency includes seven measures. These measures evaluate barriers to care experienced by patients, such as limited availability of the regular doctor, medical records, or test results. They also measure patients’ and primary care clinicians’ reports of time and effort spent dealing with paperwork, as well as disputes related to documentation requirements of insurance plans and government agencies.</p>

                        <h5>Equity</h5>

                        <p>Equity compares performance for higher- and lower-income individuals within each country, using 11 selected survey measures from the Care Process and Access domains. The analysis stratifies the surveyed populations based on reported income (above-average vs. below-average relative to the country’s median income) and calculates a percentage-point difference in performance between the two groups. A higher percentage-point difference is interpreted as a measure of lower equity among income groups in that country.</p>

                        <h5>Health Care Outcomes</h5>

                        <p>The domain Health Care Outcomes domain includes nine measures of the health of populations. Taken together, they are intended to reflect outcomes that are attributable to the performance of the countries’ health care delivery systems. The measures fall into three categories: population health outcome (i.e., those that reflect the chronic disease and mortality of populations, regardless of whether they have received health care), mortality amenable to health care (i.e., deaths under age 75 from specific causes that are considered preventable in the presence of timely and effective health care) and disease-specific health outcomes measures (including in-hospital mortality and cancer survival).</p>

                        <p>In the population health category, two measures compare countries on the mortality of populations defined by age (infant mortality and life expectancy after age 60) and one measure focuses on the proportion of surveyed nonelderly adults who report at least two of five common chronic conditions. For each country, mortality amenable to care includes both the current rate of deaths amenable to care and the 10-year trend. In the disease-specific health outcomes category, two measures focus on 30-day in-hospital mortality following myocardial infarction and stroke. Two measures examine five-year relative survival for breast cancer and colon cancer.</p>

                    <p>The United States ranks last in health care system performance among the 11 countries included in this study (Exhibit 2). The U.S. ranks last in Health Outcomes, Access, and Equity. The U.S. ranks next to last in Administrative Efficiency as reported by patients and providers. Only in Care Process does the U.S. perform better, but it still only ranks fifth among the 11 countries. Other countries that rank near the bottom of the list with the U.S. include France (10) and Canada (9).</p>

                    <p>This analysis reveals striking variations. No country ranks first consistently across all domains or measures, signifying that all countries have room to improve. The U.S., France, and Canada score lower than the 11-country average across most of the five domains, but all three achieve above-average performance on at least one domain: France on Health Care Outcomes, Canada on Care Process and Administrative Efficiency and the U.S. on Care Process. (Appendix 1).</p>

                    <h5>Top Performers</h5>

                    <p><a href="#chapter5">The top-ranked countries overall are the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands.</a> In general, the U.K. achieves superior performance compared to the other countries in all areas, except health outcomes, where it ranks 10th. The U.K. has experienced the fastest reductions in deaths amenable to health care in the past decade. Australia ranks highest on Health Care Outcomes, Administrative Efficiency, Access and Care Process but ranks low on Equity. The Netherlands is among the top performers on Access, Equity, and Care Process; its performance on Administrative Efficiency stands out as an area for improvement.</p> 

                    <p>New Zealand performs well on measures of Care Process and Administrative Efficiency, but below the 11-country average on all the other indicators. Norway and Sweden did better on Health Care Outcomes compared to the other countries, despite having relatively low rankings on Care Process. Switzerland performs well on measures of Equity and Health Care Outcomes while Germany achieves a high rank only on measures of Access.</p>

                    <p>Exhibit 3 illustrates the countries’ relative performance. It displays the same rank order as Exhibit 2, but shows this graph – based on the calculated health system performance scores for each country – shows the magnitude of the differences in performance between countries. (See Methods for a detailed explanation of how these performance scores are calculated). Notably, Exhibit 3 shows the striking lower performance of Canada (9), France (10) and the United States (11), compared to the other countries, which all group relatively closely above the 11-country average performance score.</p>
                                                                    
                    <h5>Care Process</h5>
                    <p>The United Kingdom ranks first and Sweden last on Care Process (Exhibit 2) based on the performance across the four subdomains of prevention, safe care, coordination, and patient engagement (see Box and Appendix 2). The United States falls in the middle on Care Process (5th), with stronger performance on the subdomains of prevention, safety, and engagement. The U.S. performs slightly below the 11-country average in the coordination subdomain.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. tends to excel on measures that involve the doctor–patient relationship, performing relatively better on wellness counseling related to healthy behaviors, shared decision-making with primary care and specialist providers, chronic disease management, and end-of-life discussions (Appendices 2a-2d). The U.S. also performs above the 11-country average on preventive measures like mammography screening and older adult influenza immunization rates. However, the U.S. performs poorly on several coordination measures, including information flows between primary care providers and specialist and social service providers. The U.S. also lags other countries on avoidable hospital admissions.</p>

                    <p>The U.K., Australia, and the Netherlands are the top performers in the Care Process domain. These three countries consistently perform above the 11-country average across all subdomains (except for Australia on coordinated care). The U.K. excels in safety, while Australia is the top performer in patient engagement. On the other end of the spectrum, Norway and Sweden’s performance is below average on each of the Care Process subdomains.</p>

                    <h5>Access to Care</h5>
                    <p>Overall, the United States ranks last on Access to Care (Exhibit 2). The U.S. has the poorest performance of all countries on the affordability subdomain, ranking much lower than even the second-to-last country, Switzerland (Appendix 3). The U.S. ranks ninth on the subdomain of timeliness (Appendix 3).</p>

                    <p>The Netherlands performs the best of the 11 countries on Access to Care, ranking first on timeliness and in the middle on affordability (Appendix 3). Germany ranks second on access to care, and is among the top-ranked countries on both subdomains. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, and Norway are the other top-ranked performers on affordability.</p>

                    <h5>Administrative Efficiency</h5>
                    <p>The United States ranks 10th on Administrative Efficiency (Exhibit 2). Compared to the other countries, more U.S. doctors reported problems related to insurance or claims and coverage restrictions medications or treatments (Appendix 4). Larger percentages of patients in the U.S. reported Administrative Efficiency problems compared to those in other countries (except France). The top performers in this domain are Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Norway. On the other end of the range, citizens in France were most likely to report problems in this area among the surveyed countries.</p>

                    <h5>Equity</h5>
                    <p>The United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sweden rank highest on measures related to the equity of health systems with respect to access and care process (Exhibit 2). In these three countries, there are relatively small differences between lower- and higher-income adults on the 11 measures related to access and financial barriers to care and experiencing patient-centered care (Appendix 5).</p>

                    <p>In contrast, the United States, France, and Canada have larger disparities in Care Process and Access to Care between lower and higher-income adults. These countries ranked lowest in Equity. They had especially large disparities on measures related to financial barriers, such as skipping needed doctor’s visits or dental care, forgoing treatments or tests, and not filling prescriptions because of the cost.</p>

The U.S. has the highest rate of mortality amenable to health care and has experienced the smallest decline in that measure during the past decade (Exhibit 4). In contrast, the U.S. appears to perform relatively well on 30-day in-hospital mortality after heart attack or stroke. The U.S. also performs as well as several top performers on breast cancer five-year relative survival rate and close to the 11-country average on colorectal cancer five-year relative survival rates. </p>

                    <p>Australia had the best health care outcomes overall. Sweden and Norway rank second and third in the health care outcomes domain. While the United Kingdom ranks 10th in the health care outcomes domain overall, it had the largest decline in mortality amenable to health care during the past decade.</p>

                    <p>The United States ranks last in health care system performance. Its shortcomings are broad and consistent across domains, including several measures of distinct aspects of health care performance. Performance is relatively poor in the areas of health care outcomes, access to care, administrative efficiency, and equity. Only within the domain of care process is U.S. performance above the 11-country average. The U.S. spends the most per capita on health, yet has the poorest health system performance overall. Across countries, neither higher incomes nor higher health spending is associated with better health system performance.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. health care system is unique in several respects. It is the only country lacking universal health insurance coverage. Incomplete and fragmented insurance coverage may account for the relatively poor performance of the U.S. on health care outcomes, affordability, administrative efficiency, and equity. While the U.S. has taken an important step to expand insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, more than 25 million Americans still lack health insurance coverage and it may take time for the population health benefits of insurance coverage to become apparent. Furthermore, Americans—even those with coverage—often face far higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs than citizens of other nations, whose systems offer more financial protection.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. can learn important lessons from other high-income countries. The Netherlands, a top performer in several categories, has long organized local neighborhood access to primary care and offers after-hours care, including urgent home visits if needed. The U.S. performs poorly in administrative efficiency, mainly due to doctors and patients reporting poor billing and claims experiences. Ironically, the U.S. spends far more than other countries on billing and administration hoping to generate competition among multiple insurance plans, products, and providers. Other countries that rely on private health insurers, like the Netherlands, minimize some of these problems by standardizing basic benefit packages which can both reduce administrative burden for providers and ensure that patients face predictable co-payments.</p>

                    <p>The U.K. stands out as a top performer in most categories except for health care outcomes, where it ranks with the U.S. near the bottom. The U.K., in contrast to the U.S., has had a larger decline in mortality amenable to health care (i.e., a greater improvement in the measure) over the past decade than the other countries studied. (The U.S. has had the smallest decline, or lowest level of improvement.) In the early 2000s, the U.K. made a major investment in its National Health Service, reforming primary care and cancer care in addition to increasing health care spending from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2000 to 9.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (Exhibit 1).7 The relative contribution of the reforms and increased spending is uncertain.</p>

                    <p>There is a striking contrast between the U.S’s poor performance on infant mortality, life expectancy, and amenable mortality and its relatively better performance on in-hospital mortality after heart attack or stroke. Researchers have noted that the only modest decline in the rate of amenable mortality in the U.S. may be attributable to hypertension and cerebrovascular disease that lead to cardiovascular mortality.8 These findings highlight the combined impact of a lack of universal insurance coverage and barriers to access to primary care and suggest that the U.S. could make gains by investing more in preventing chronic disease. The high level of inequity in the U.S. health care system intensifies the problem. For the first time in decades, mid-life mortality for less-educated Americans is rapidly increasing.2</p>

                    <p>Exhibit 5 demonstrates that the U.S. health system is a substantial outlier when it comes to achieving value. Despite spending nearly twice as much as several other countries, the U.S.’s  performance is lackluster. This poor return on our extraordinary national investment in health care is tragic, but international comparisons can point out ways to improve the American health care system. Recent incremental reductions in readmissions and hospital-acquired conditions after the passage of the ACA suggest U.S. health care can be improved. To gain more than incremental improvement, however, the U.S. may need to pursue very different approaches to organizing and financing health care. </p>

                <h2>Lessons for the United States</h2>
                
                    <p>Comparing nations’ health care system performance using standardized performance data can offer benchmarks and other useful insights about how to improve care. Among the 11 countries we studied, the U.S. was ranked last in overall health system performance, while spending the most per capita on health care. The insurance, payment, and delivery system of the ACA have improved some aspects of health care system performance, but the U.S. still lags far behind countries with universal health insurance coverage. The top performing countries—the U.K., Australia, and the Netherlands—could offer important lessons to the U.S. and other outliers.</p>

                            Diversity Among Health Systems Achieving Top Marks
                        </div>

                        <div class="js-body" >
                            <p>The three countries with the best overall health system performance scores have strikingly different health care systems. All three provide universal coverage and access, but do so in different ways, suggesting that high performance can be achieved through a variety of payment and organizational approaches.</p>

                            <p>Experts generally group universal coverage systems into three categories: Beveridge systems, single-payer systems, and multipayer systems. These three systems are represented among our highest performers.</p>

                            <h4>The U.K.’s National Health Service.</h4>
                            <p>The Beveridge model takes its name after the creator of Britain’s National Health Service, William Beveridge. In the NHS, health services are paid for through general tax revenue, as opposed to insurance premiums. Furthermore, the government plays a significant role in organizing and operating the delivery of health care. For example, most hospitals are publicly owned, and the specialists who work in them are often government employees. This is not true of all providers. Most general practitioner practices are privately owned. Health care in the U.K. and other Beveridge countries is centrally directed and has more direct management accountability to the government than in other health systems.</p>

                            <h4>Australia’s Single-Payer Insurance Program.</h4>
                            <p>In Australia, everyone is covered under the public insurance plan, Medicare. Much like the NHS, Australia’s Medicare is funded through a combination of general tax revenue and an earmarked income tax. Medicare is distinguished, though, by lesser public involvement in care delivery. Many Australian hospitals are private, and roughly half the population purchases private health insurance to access care outside the public system. Australia’s Medicare closely resembles Medicare in the U.S. In comparison, the NHS more closely resembles the U.S. Veterans Health Administration.</p>
                            <h4>Netherland’s Competing Private Insurers.</h4>
                            <p>Unlike Australia and the U.K., the Dutch health system relies on private insurers to fund health services for its population. These are mainly financed through community-rated premiums and payroll taxes, which are pooled and then distributed to insurers based on the risk profile of their enrollees. All plans include a standard basic benefit package; subsidies are available for people with low incomes; adults are required to enroll in a plan or must pay a fine. Dutch health care providers are predominantly private. This multipayer system—partly inspired by the managed competition model—shares many similarities with the insurance marketplaces created under the Affordable Care Act.

                        <p>This edition of Mirror, Mirror reflects refinements to methodology used in past reports. No report can claim to capture every aspect of the performance of health care systems. Health care systems are complex. Even if a report included thousands of measures, nuances would remain. In that spirit, the report underwent a thorough review by an advisory panel of international, independent performance measurement experts. The framework for Mirror, Mirror 2017 was developed in consultation with the advisory panel from January through December 2016.</p>

                        <p>The indicators were carefully selected from among the best-available measures with comparable data across the included nations. The selected measures cover a wide range of performance domains. Mirror, Mirror is unique in its use of survey measures designed to gather the perspectives of patients and professionals—the people who experience health care directly in each country every day.</p>
                        <strong>Data</strong>
                        <p>Data are drawn from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Surveys. The 2014 and 2016 surveys were of the general population; our analysis of the 2014 survey was restricted to adults ages 65 and older. The 2015 survey was of primary care physicians. Appendix 9 presents the number of respondents for each survey.</p> 
                        <p>The 2014 and 2016 surveys examined patients’ views of the health care system, quality of care, care coordination, medical errors, patient–physician communication, waiting times, and access problems. The 2015 survey looked at primary care physicians’ experiences providing care to patients, as well as the use of information technology and teamwork in the provision of care. Further details of the survey methodology are described elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>To broaden the scope of this report, we also included data from external sources on quality and health care outcomes. We included data from the OECD on screening, immunization, preventable hospital admissions, population health, and disease-specific outcomes. We also included measures of population health from the World Health Organization and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies. </p>

                        <p>In total, this report included 72 indicators, grouped into five dimensions of health system performance: Care Process, Access, Administrative Efficiency, Equity, and Health Care Outcomes.</p>

                        <p>Our method of calculating country ranks proceeded as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Indicator-level: For each country, we calculated a score based on how many standard deviations the value is from the 11-country mean. (A positive score indicates the country performs better than average; a negative score indicates the country performs worse than average.) </li>

                                <li>Domain-level: For each country, we calculated the mean of the indicator scores for all indicators in that domain. Then, we ranked each country from one to 11 based on that mean, with one indicating the top-ranked country and 11 indicating the last-ranked country.</li>

                                <li>Overall ranking: For each country, we calculated the mean of the five domain scores. Then, we ranked each country from one to 11 based on this mean score.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <strong>Sensitivity Analyses<br></strong>
                        <em>Monte Carlo Analysis</em>
                        <p>In order to test the stability of this ranking method, we ran two Monte Carlo-like tests to observe whether small changes in the indicators included in the report or their values had a material effect on the overall rankings. For the first test, we removed three variables from the analysis at random, and then calculated the overall rankings on the remaining 69 variables. For the second test, we randomized the values in Mirror, Mirror that come from Commonwealth Fund international surveys within a 95 percent confidence interval of +/- 3 percentage points, and then calculated the overall rankings on the adjusted data. We ran both tests 1,000 times to observe the variability in the rankings that results from these relatively minor changes.</p>

                        <p>The results indicated that country rankings were quite sensitive to small changes in the underlying data, but also that countries were clustered together. The U.K., Australia, and the Netherlands were virtually always ranked as the three top countries; the U.S., France and Canada were virtually always ranked as the three bottom countries. The other five countries were typically ranked between 5th and 9th, though not in a stable order.</p>

                        <em>Alternative Ranking Methods</em>
                        <p>We also experimented with several different ranking methodologies to see if they yielded the same or similar results. One approach scored countries by whether they were “well above” or “well below” the 11-country mean (based on a threshold of -0.5 and 0.5 standard deviations). Another approach mirrored our methods in earlier versions of this report, which assigned ordinal ranks to countries on each indicator.</p>
                        <p>We found that these alternative methods consistently yielded the same top-performing and bottom-performing countries. However, as with the Monte Carlo analysis, we observed a fair amount of fluidity among the countries in the middle of the performance range. For this reason, overall rankings may overshadow important absolute differences in performance, warranting closer examination of the data when describing a particular country’s performance.</p>

                        <strong>Limitations</strong>
                        <p>This report has several limitations. Some are related to the particulars of our analysis and some inherent in any effort to assess overall health system performance.</p>

                        <p>First, as described above, our sensitivity analyses suggest that the overall country rankings are somewhat sensitive to small changes in the data or indicators included in the analysis. </p>

                        <p>Second, despite improvements in recent years, the availability of cross-national data on health system performance remains highly variable. The Commonwealth Fund surveys offer unique and detailed data on the experiences of patients and primary care physicians. However, they do not capture important dimensions that might be obtained from medical records or administrative data. Furthermore, patients’ and physicians’ assessments might be affected by their expectations, which could differ by country and culture. In this report, we augment our survey data with other international sources, and include several important indicators of population health and disease-specific outcomes. However, in general, the report relies predominantly on patient experience measures. Furthermore, there is little cross-national data available on mental health services and on long-term care services.</p>

                        <p>Third, we base our assessment of overall health system performance on five domains—Care Process, Access, Health Care Outcomes, Administrative Efficiency, and Equity—which we weight equally in calculating each countries’ overall performance score. Some commentators in the past have argued that there are other important elements of system performance that should also be considered, such as innovativeness or value. After consideration, and based on discussions with our advisory panel, we decided not to add new domains to the report. We believe our current five domains capture a sufficiently broad and comprehensive view of health system performance. In addition, there was a lack of meaningful data to assess these new domains.</p>
